PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 

	Our group has decided to build a web application titled ‘Bus Seat Reservation System’. The system will allow the user to book a seat earlier than the actual date instead of going to the actual physical counter that will cost them their time and money (Transportation and etc). The implementation of this system will be very similar to the actual transaction found at the physical ticket counter, where the customer will have to choose a time and date, bus type and verify transaction. 
	Additional features that our web application has to offer is that we will allow them to edit their personal information and cancel their reservation within a specific time set by us. Any cancellation made outside the time set will be charged. At the same time, to ensure our integrity in handling their information, we will validate the user or customer by asking them to login before using any features in our web application system. 



1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

1.2.1 Background of the problem 

From our discussion, we decided to develop a web application system because this platform can be accessed on many devices and easier to be implemented. The expected users would be teenagers and adults aged between 15 and 50 years old since they are much familiar with the browser and websites. Currently, users normally buy ticket at the physical counter. However, they need to queue up in long lines just to buy a bus ticket. 
At the same time, neither do they can make any cancellation or edit their personal information once they buy the tickets. For confirmation wise, they will need to carry the physical tickets around and make sure they did not misplaced it. Once the ticket is gone, they need to go to the counter again which is an inconvenience for those who are far away or do not have the time.

1.2.2 Problem Statement 

Listed below are the problems that we found on the existing system or website:

Content of the system is too much(heavy) and took time for loading the page
Users cannot edit the details after proceed to payment page
Navigation menu is not consistent for every page
System did not provide step by step guide to reduce browsing time
No instruction at current page to proceed to the next page
Cannot update vacant seat after customer canceled at payment page



1.3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

To develop a web application that can solve all tedious tasks related to bus seat reservation system.

1.3.1 This system will lead to an increase in the bus seat reservation efficiency.
1.3.2 This system project is made as user friendly as possible so that anyone can   use it with little knowledge of system computers.
1.3.3 The objective of our project is to make easy the bus seat reservation project system simple, reliable, user friendly, and corrective. Moreover less time consuming as compared to manual work.


1.4 PROJECT SCOPE 

1.4.1 Scope 

1.4.1 Homepage
User can get a general idea what our project served to them or can do. User can sign up for the first time. It will capture information such as name, address, phone number and email address. Navigation bar is consistent so that user easy to use.

	1.4.2 Login
User needs to login to book the ticket. Personal information can be edited if any change to be made once they login.

. 
1.4.2 Targeted User 

This website will be opened to the public. Any adults or teenagers that wanted to do any seat reservation can use the system and will have to log in first. Teenagers and adults aged between 15 and 50 years old since they are much familiar with the browser and websites.

1.4.3 Specific Platform 


1.4.3.1 Software Requirement for Development

Microsoft Office Word
Web browser
Eclipse
HTML
CSS
JSP

		1.4.3.2 Hardware Requirement for Development

Laptops
Wi-Fi


			

1.5 CONSTRAINTS 

In developing the project, there are a few constraints that may cause us some difficulties. The major constraint is the time itself when it is hard to find time especially for discussion as everyone is getting busy especially towards the end of the semester. We also need the time to do research and find relatable codes that can be used as a guideline.

Another constraint that we realized is the ability of the member to commit and settle the task as they might be lack of certain skills to solve the problem. This may be related to the time also as more time might be needed to accomplish the project .


1.6 PROJECT STAGES 



To complete the project, we had already divided our web development into several stages.

Stage 1 : Complete the Project Proposal (8/12/2019)

The first stage is for us to discuss and set all the milestones regarding the project. We are getting the  requirements needed and also finishing the project proposal.


	Stage 2: Project Development Period (9/12/2019 - 13/12/2019)

This stage is focusing on the development of the project after we divided all the tasks to group members. All the coding will try to be resolved during this period before every part will be compiled later.



	Stage 3: Project Compilation (14/12/2019 - 15/12/2019)

	We will compile all the divided tasks before doing the final testing of the project. Any  error during the compilation will also be amended during this period.

	Stage 4 : Project Closing and Presentation (16/12/2019)
		
		Final touch will be done as well as the preparation for the presentation.



1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 

We hope by developing this ‘Bus Seat Reservation System’ we can ease the users to buy tickets. By using the system, they can save their energy and money to go to the physical ticket counters to get their tickets. We also provide them with the flexibility of the tickets booking by allowing them to cancel any reservation made within a specific time or durations. 

1.8 SUMMARY 

To summarise, we were hoping that our proposal will be accepted. Based on the above details, we can ensure you that system will help ease a lot of people transactions by providing the online seat reservation system. We will be designing and developing based on the problems that we found in the current system because we want to ensure that the users will not face the same problems again. We will also make sure that the system is user-friendly which means it is easy to navigate through out the webpages and easy to learn.
